When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    - As a backup of my local repository
    - To share my work with the rest of the world!
    - For sharing a project with among team members
    - To be able to work from several computers or locations (home/work/school)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If Git were pushing and pulling new files everytine a local commit
    is done, it would be a nightmare in a collaborative environment!
    Imagine a project for which 15 developers work togthere. After each
    local commit, the 14 other people would be force to interrupt their
    working flow to update their repositories and deal with whatever
    conflit occured.
